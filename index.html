                            <p>Depression is the most common mood disorder, affecting hundreds of millions worldwide. It can be particularly debilitating in severe cases. For the final capstone project of my Data Science Immersive Program, I created an early detection system, capable of detecting the likelihood of depression indicated from text data.
                            <br>
                            <br>This system implemented two neural network models. The first was built on vectorized representations of the training data using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (bERT) word embeddings, with a Bi-LSTM neural network architecture. The second model was trained on sentiment scores computed for each data point in the text corpus, with a feed-forward network architecture. The models were folded together based on their predicted probabilities of depression, resulting in a more robust combined model, that had 87% accuracy with the validation set.
                            <br>
                            <br>This was also converted into a web application which can take user input and output the predicted probability of the text being indicative of depression based on the model. The application also includes a 7-day mood-tracker based on the same journal-style inputs for each day.

                            <br>
                            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been the world’s most pressing health crisis since the end of 2019. And with so much data being reported and collected every single, it was a subject both extremely relevant and rich for analysis. With this in mind, my team and I set out to conduct a series of analyses of the virus’s progression in the United States, the country which arguably has been hit the hardest.
                            <br>
                            <br>Among our analyses included a least squares regression which correlated case and death rate data with data from a mask sentiment survey collected by state, to observe the relationship between opinions on wearing masks and the rate of case growth as well as rate of deaths per state. We also analyzed the relationship between political party and case growth, as there is an observable divide in sentiment between parties. 
                            <br>
                            <br>To grant users the ability to quickly visualize COVID metrics for each US state over the entire progression period of the virus, we created a series of web applications with customizable displays. These allowed the users to visualize relative and cumulative case growth per state, view it in choropleth format, as well as compare progression for multiple states.

                            <p>Reddit is a massive online community-based platform, containing subreddits on an incredibly diverse array of subjects. My goal for this project was to take two of these subreddits, and see if I could build a classification model capable of understanding which posts correspond to each.
                            <br>
                            <br>I used the PushShift API to scrape a total of 40,000 posts from the r/PersonalFinance and r/Investing communities. After data cleaning, I created multiple classifiers using either CountVectorization or TFIDFVectorization for preprocessing, and several classification models including Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. Logistic Regression with CountVectorization was the most effective with a validation accuracy of 86%.

                    <p>Apart from being a data scientist, I love to play piano, from classical pieces and jazz, to adaptations of my favorite songs. I love to create music as well, building arrangements for a cappella, and occasionally recording some of these projects myself as well.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">I’m also unabashedly an avid gamer, and I love to get lost in the worlds and stories of games in genres ranging from realistic open world, to historical fiction, to science fiction, and many more.
